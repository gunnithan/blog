#### Hi, I am Girish,
I am a technology buff who started my journey with computers in the summer of 1992. My curiosity in all things digital took me from a software centric career into the exciting world of digital marketing since 2009.

#### My blogging journey
started way back in 2009 on blogger.com blogging on everything and anything that tickled my interest.

I registered oxheygen.com in July 2016 and thereafter moved over to a Jekyll powered blog. I decided to clear the slate and start afresh.

I decided to go the _Jekyll_ route because I felt that wordpress would be overkill for a static blog. However, I did have to acquire a few simple new skills to make this transition.

#### Oxheygen
is all about various tech stuff that I have been dabbling in over the years including but not limited to open source, blogging, linux/ubuntu, digital marketing & mobile.
